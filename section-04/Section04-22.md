# 22. Simple Linear Regression Intuition - Step 1

## SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION 1

### Regressions
* Simple Linear Regression -> y = b0 + b1 * x1
* y is the Dependent variable (DV)
* Something you are trying to understand how it depends on something else
* x1 is the Independent variable (IV)
* so x1 might have an implied association between Independent variable and Dependent variable
* b1 is the coefficient for the dependent variable
* It kind of says how the effect or how a change in x1, a unit change in x1
* Unit changes in x1 how that affects a unit change in Y.
* So it is also the proportion to which that change in inflated or deflated 

### Simple Linear Regression
* Experience is going to be our horizontal axis (X) 
* Salary ($) is going to be our Vertical axis (Y)
* And what that essentially means is just putting a line through your chart that best fits this data
* When the experience is equals to 0, salary will equals to b0 which will be $30,000
* So someone with no experience, assuming fresh from university will most likely have a salary about $30,000
* b1 is the slope of the line
* The steeper the line, the more you get more salary, based on the experience
