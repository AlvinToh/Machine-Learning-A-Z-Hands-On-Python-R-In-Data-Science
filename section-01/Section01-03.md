# 3. Important notes, tips & tricks for this course

### Instructor Notes

Dear students,

we want you to have the best learning experience during the whole journey of this course. Therefore, please find just below some important notes to understand, as well as tips & tricks to take this course in the best conditions:

1. The practical activities of this course will be done in both Python and R. However, it is absolutely not required to do these practical cases in both programming languages. This course was designed so that people can learn Machine Learning whether they use Python or R in their company, their own business or any specific project. Hence everybody can get comfortable applying Machine Learning on their favorite programming language. But definitely you are not supposed to learn the two. You can do it if you want or if you need it for your work, but usually one of them is sufficient.

2. If you wish to learn both programming languages, just be prepared that there are going to be some repetitions. This is normal, the reasons for this is that there are a lot of similarities between Python and R and of course the practical cases solved in this course are the same for these two programming languages. However, just bear in mind that repetitions are not that bad: you will learn a lot of concepts and techniques in this course and the fact that we repeat the same elements from one programming language to another will help these concepts stick better in your head.

3. The video lectures of this course were recorded at a certain pace so that everybody can adjust the speed to learn at their own rhythm. To adjust the speed you simply need to click the following "Speed" button at the bottom left corner of the video lecture: If you find the pace too slow you can increase the speed to 1.25x, 1.5x or even 2x. If you find the pace too fast you can decrease the speed to 0.75x or 0.5x.

4. If there is anything unclear or if you have any question during a Lecture, please keep in mind that there is a very high chance another student asked for some clarifications on the exact same element you need. You can easily find the answer to your question by browsing the Q&A of the specific Lecture you are watching. To browse the Q&A of the Lecture you simply need to click "Browse Q&A" at the bottom of the Lecture: Once you click "Browse Q&A" you will see all the questions and answers related to this Lecture on the right side of the screen: As you can see the questions have titles so you will easily find the same question you are wondering about. If you don't find your question you can of course ask a new question in the Q&A of the Lecture you are in.

We will add more tips & tricks based on our observations of students feedbacks. In the meantime we wish you the best learning experience.

Enjoy Machine Learning!
