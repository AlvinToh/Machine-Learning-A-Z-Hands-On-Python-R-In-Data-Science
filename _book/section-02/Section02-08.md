# Welcome to Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

## DATA PREPROCESSING

### Importance of Data Preprocessing
* If there is no data pre-processing your machine learning model won't work properly.
* So its like preparing for a journey, imagine you are about to go for a long journey while you have to prepare your itinenary, your flights, your hotel bookings and packing your lauggage.
* We have to prepare some stuff in order to make sure that we build our machine learning models without any issues.
* And this stuff that we need to prepare for machine learning trip happens to be data pre-processing.
* We have to do it because if we don't do it we miss out on all the fun of machine learning.
* I will make sure to make sure it as simple as possible there is all you need to know about data-processing.
* There is all you need to know how to do to prepare any data set for any machine learning model.
