# 10. Importing the Libraries

## PYTHON IMPORTING THE LIBRARIES

### Learning how to import the Libraries
* So we are going to teach you how to import the libraries and the tutorial is going to be split into two parts
* The first part of the tutorial will be in Python and the second part will be in R.
* Open up Spyder IDE, in Anaconda Navigator.

### Activity
* So create a Python file named Data_Processing, and we learn how to import Libraries
```
	# Data Processing

	# Reporting the libraries
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import pandas as pd
```
* Numpy is the library that we need to include any types of mathematics in our age.
* Machine learning models are based on mathematics then we will absolutely need Numpy
* Matplotlib is a library that is going to help us plot nice charts
* Pandas is really the best library to import data sets and manage data sets.
* So with that we have imported the three most essential libraries in Python
* Data_processing.py contains my python code for importing the 3 libraries.
* If you open RStudio, you do not need to import any libraries because most of the libraries are included in RStudio IDE.
